# Macrostrat API V1

## General structure
Each route has it's own file. ````api.js```` creates the Express.js router, and the logic of each route is mapped to its URL in ````index.js````, which allows you to ````require()```` each version of the API.


## Common tasks
Test - ````npm test````
Build output fields and check for missing definitions - ````npm run-script build````


## larkin.js
Larkin is a collection of reusable conviniences and utilities used in every route.


### .connectMySQL
Called once when the API is started - creates a connection to MySQL using the credentials supplied in ````credentials.js````.


### .queryPg(database, sql, parameters, callback, send, res, format)
Runs a query on a Postgres database given a ````database````, ````sql````, ````parameters````, and a ````callback````. Can optionally directly send the data given ````send````, a boolean, ````res````, and a desired ouput ````format````. Unlike MySQL, node-pg does not create a pool to draw connections from, but rather creates a new connection for each query.


### .query(sql, parameters, callback, send, res, format)
Runs a query on a database (supplied in ````credentials.js````) using the supplied parameters. As with ````.queryPg````, result can be directly sent to the client if ````send````, ````res````, and ````format```` are supplied.


### .sendData(data, res, format)
Sends ````data```` to the client with an encoding specified for ````format````.


### .sendCompact(data, res, format)
Same as ````.sendData````, but removes all whitespace from the response for an ugly, but compact response. Ideal for routes that always return large amounts of data, such as those that return geographic data.


### .sendBare(data, res)
Same as ````.sendCompact````, but removes the response wrapper (````{"success": {....}}````). Used for formats ````geojson_bare```` and ````topojson_bare```` to increase interoperability with other tools and utilities such as QGIS.


### .info(request, res)
Given a request, return a definition of the route to the client. Used for the base of all routes, i.e. ````/units````.


### .error(req, res, next, message, code)
Return an error and route definition to the client with an optional ````message```` and error code. Used when bad requests are made, usually with unknown or unusable parameters.


### .log(type, messsage)
Simply log something to the console. A convinience for ````console.log````.


### .defineFields(route, callback)
Fetches and returns all field definitions for a given route. Always called by ````.defineRoute````.


### .defineRoute(route, callback)
Forms a definition response for a given route. Fetches all field defintions using ````.defineFields````. Usually called by ````.error````.


### .getOutputFormat(requestedFormat)
Given a requested format, simply maps ````geojson_bare```` to ````geojson````, ````topojson_bare```` to ````topojson````, and ````geojson```` and ````topojson```` to ````geojson````.


### .jsonifyPipes(data, data_type)
Takes a pipe-delimited field and turns it into a JSON array, with an optional ````data_type````, which can be "integers", "floats", or "strings". Defaults to "strings".

````
var output = "54|1|98";

output = larkin.jsonifyPipes(output, "numeric");

    --> output now equals [54, 1, 98]

var someStrings = "carbonate|marine|shallow subtidal";

someStrings = larkin.jsonifyPipes(someStrings);

    --> someStrings now equals ["carbonate", "marine", "shallow subtidal"]
````
